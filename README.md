# SjccBingo
Bingo program for SJCC

# Tutorial
On the main screen, you'll see 3 buttons, accompanied by a number indicator, and a smaller view of the board.

## `Pick Number` button
Press this button to generate a new number, and display it on the board

## `Reset Board` button
Press this button to clear all of the currently-lit numbers off the board. In effect, turns off all the lights on the board and clears all already-called numbers.

## `Help` dropdown
Press this to get 2 sub-options, `Tutorial`, which brings you to this page, and `About`, which brings you to the creator's profile (mine)

## Number Indicator
Every time you press `Pick Number`, the number that was randomly chosen will appear here in the format `Letter-Number`. When you first start a game, it will say `Ready`.

## Smaller Board View
This is a smaller, exact copy of the board that's currently being shown in the larger window.
